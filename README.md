# OpenPCDet

`OpenPCDet` is a clear, simple, self-contained open source project for LiDAR-based 3D object detection. 

It is also the official code release of [`[PointRCNN]`](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04244), [`[Part-A2-Net]`](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03670), [`[PV-RCNN]`](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.13192), [`[Voxel R-CNN]`](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15712), [`[PV-RCNN++]`](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00463) and [`[MPPNet]`](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05979).

## Installation
Please refer to [INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md) for the installation of `OpenPCDet`.

## Quick Demo
Please refer to [DEMO.md](docs/DEMO.md) for a quick demo to test with a pretrained model and 
visualize the predicted results on your custom data or the original KITTI data.

## Getting Started
Please refer to [GETTING_STARTED.md](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) to learn more usage about this project.

## License
`OpenPCDet` is released under the [Apache 2.0 license](LICENSE).

## Acknowledgement
`OpenPCDet` is an open source project for LiDAR-based 3D scene perception that supports multiple
LiDAR-based perception models as shown above. Some parts of `PCDet` are learned from the official released codes of the above supported methods. 
We would like to thank for their proposed methods and the official implementation.   

We hope that this repo could serve as a strong and flexible codebase to benefit the research community by speeding up the process of reimplementing previous works and/or developing new methods.
